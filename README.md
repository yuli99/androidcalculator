# Android Scientific Calculator

Description:    
The main function of this android application is to perform scientific calculations. A light weight exp4j 
library is used to evaluate the inputted math equation. Its built-in trigonometric functions are rewritten 
in order to handle both radians and degrees. The side functions of this application are to convert units and 
to calculate the volume and the surface area of 3d geometric shapes. Their UI design are very similar. Both of 
them use the slide-in menu for navigation. Long-pressing on the outputted value copies it to clipboard; long-pressing 
on the input field pastes the value from the clipboard. Pressing the floating action button starts the conversion/calculation.
